#BlueMix Image Sorter  
Image sorting application built at the 2016 HackNC held at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC

##What it does  
This is a simple java desktop application that can organize your photo album by sorting them into categories.
Suppose you have an album with pictures of people, cars, landscapes, and animals, it will create a folder for
each of these categories and copy the pictures to the respective folders.

##Technologies/API used
The application uses a simple java Swing GUI.
It connects with the IBM BlueMix Visual Recognition web service to get the categories for the pictures and sorts them on level 1 classification. Application can be extended to have more in depth structuring by using level 2 and level 3 classifications for giving more accurate object categories. 

##Challenges faced
It was our first time we tried IBM Bluemix and it consumed most of our time. But soon after understanding its structure, we started working on our project. We had multiple ideas in mind which uses bluemix to its maximum extent, but for this project we limited ourselves because of time constraints.
